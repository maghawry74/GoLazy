# GoLazy

## Description

#### Go Lazy is a simple project to automate the opening of certain apps together.
#### I Created It to open work apps with a single command instead of opening them seperatly

## How to Use It

1. First Make sure go is installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repo.
3. Open helper.go and put the paths of desired apps in []*exec.Cmd Array.
4. Run Command "go install ."
5. You can now run the command from terminal using "lazy"

## Planning To Do
* Making the app configurabe througth a json file instead of hard coding the apps.
